# Chat Application Website!
For our CS110 Final Project, our group decided to implement a chat application (lab 6) with 3 extra features. The extra features we chose to implement were 2 Factor Authentication, a good design, and an edit message functionality.

## Discussion
Because we chose to implment a good design as one of our three features, our group spent a considerable amount of time planning, coding, and laying out an aesthetic application appearence as well as an easy to use UX.

For our registration and login screen, we decided to take inspiration from websites that have a half-half split layout. This is where half of the screen is dedicated to mostly interactable content like the actual login and registration forms while the other half of the screen is dedicated to informing the user about some aspect of the site or to provide instructions.

### Registration and Login Forms

The login form provides fields for username and password a dual factor authentication code while the signup form prompts for a username, password, and the screen name that you would like to appear alongside your messages.

Inspired by aquatic darkmode themes, we choose to go for a color pallette with dark ocean blues combined with brighter qualities like green and red buttons to produce an almost oceanic photoluminiscent mood. Although dark themes are intended and designed to be easier on the eyes, in our opnion, dark themes should convey a sense of relaxation with their color combinations.

The main purpose of the lobby is to be able to join any chatroom, create a chatroom with any name, generate a new two factor authentication code, and logging out.

The chatroom features edit message and send messages. When another user in the room sends a message, your screen updates to show their message too! A user can only edit messages that they themselves had orignally written. This means a user cannot edit everysingle message in the chat unless they wrote every message in the chat.
